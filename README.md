# Multilevel Process Environment
A multilevel business process environment written in Java and XQuery.

##Prerequisites
The multilevel business process environment works in conjunction with an XML database management system.

###1.) Download and install an XML database management system

We recommend BaseX: http://basex.org/

###2.) Start the XML database management system in server mode
The process environment will access the XML database as a server.
You don't actually need to create a database to run the test cases.
    
For BaseX see:
